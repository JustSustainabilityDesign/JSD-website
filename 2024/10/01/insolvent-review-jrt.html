<p>Christoph’s book “Insolvent” was reviewed at length in the Journal of Responsible Technology by a very capable team of researchers. 
Their conclusion: “Overall, Insolvent renders great service to the social sciences’ understanding of computing as an important science and technology and articulates a fierce reflexive critique of computer science from within the field”</p>
