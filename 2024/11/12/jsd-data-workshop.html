<p>The Just Sustainability Design Lab at University of Toronto’s Faculty of Information 
invites you to join us for an online open workshop session on ‘Responsible Data Curation and Reuse in the Age of AI’ 
on November 25, 2024 from 1:00pm to 3:00pm.</p>

<p>In this workshop, we will share past and ongoing research projects from the lab and 
invite others to share their research and perspectives. Please find the speakers’ bios below. We look forward to your participation!</p>

<p>Register here for the workshop: <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/rFEqpaurav">https://forms.office.com/r/rFEqpaurav</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Eshta Bhardwaj:</strong> Eshta Bhardwaj is a PhD student at the Faculty of Information studying 
data practices in machine learning. Her research interests include examining how dataset development 
processes within machine learning research can be improved with the adoption of data curation principles and 
concerns of fairness, accountability, and transparency in data work. In this talk, she will present two phases of an 
ongoing <a href="https://justsustainabilitydesign.org/datacurationinML/">research project</a> which establishes how data curation 
principles can be applied to curate ML datasets.</p>

<p><strong>Ciara Zogheib:</strong> Ciara Zogheib is a PhD student at the Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto. 
Her current research explores the information practices of cross-domain data work. More broadly, her research interests 
are in data studies, information practice, and interdisciplinarity. In the talk, she discusses that within the context of 
interdisciplinary and collaborative research, researchers often talk about ‘integrating’ data and information across domains. 
Pragmatically, though, the activities that comprise cross-domain integration are often overlooked and not documented as ‘methods’ 
for evaluation and critique. Thus she presents how we might treat cross-domain integration as a data practice, and invites attendees to 
engage with an in-progress question guide with the goal of documenting the activities associated with this practice.</p>

<p><strong>Syed Ashfaq Hussain:</strong> He is a <a href="https://www.arc.ed.tum.de/ai/team/syed-ashfaq-hussain-shah/">research associate and PhD candidate</a> 
at the chair of Architectural Informatics at 
Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany. His <a href="https://portal.fis.tum.de/en/persons/syed-ashfaq-hussain">research interests</a> 
include research data management, social, and 
entrepreneurial aspects of digitisation and modern IT systems. In his talk titled “Sustainable research data management 
planning”, he presents a systematic approach and topics of research data management from a strategy and policy-making perspective 
on the example of a large collaborative research center. He also discusses the foundation for dynamic data management plans in 
collaborative virtual research environment.</p>

<p>Agenda:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Introduction</li>
  <li>Context document activity</li>
  <li>Research talks (3) and discussion</li>
  <li>Other research and lightning talks</li>
</ol>
