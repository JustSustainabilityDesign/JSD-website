  <p data-search="Studies of dataset development in machine learning call for greater attention to the data practices that make model development possible and shape its outcomes  Many argue that the adoption of theory and practices from archives and data curation fields can support greater fairness  accountability  transparency  and more ethical machine learning In response  we are examining data practices in machine learning dataset development through the lens of data curation  We evaluate data practices in machine learning as data curation practices For our first paper on this topic   Machine Learning Data Practices through a Data Curation Lens  An Evaluation Framework   we evaluated data practices in machine learning as data curation practices  We developed an evaluation rubric and applied it to a sample of NeurIPS papers to see what we would find  It was accepted at the ACM Conference on Fairness  Accountability  and Transparency  ACM FAccT 2024  The 12 minute talk is available on YouTube  The paper can be read here To evaluate data practices in machine learning as data curation practices  we developed a framework for evaluating machine learning datasets using data curation concepts and principles through a rubric  Through a mixed methods analysis of evaluation results for 25 ML datasets  we study the feasibility of data curation principles to be adopted for machine learning data work in practice and explore how data curation is currently performed  We find that researchers in machine learning  which often emphasizes model development  struggle to apply standard data curation principles  Our findings illustrate difficulties at the intersection of these fields  such as evaluating dimensions that have shared terms in both fields but non shared meanings  a high degree of interpretative flexibility in adapting concepts without prescriptive restrictions  obstacles in limiting the depth of data curation expertise needed to apply the rubric  and challenges in scoping the extent of documentation dataset creators are responsible for  We propose ways to address these challenges and develop an overall framework for evaluation that outlines how data curation concepts and methods can inform machine learning data practices ">
    Our paper, Machine Learning Data Practices through a Data Curation Lens: An Evaluation Framework, has been accepted at the ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT 2024). See full post for the links to the paper and recorded talk.
