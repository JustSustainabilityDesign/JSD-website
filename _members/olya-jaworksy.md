Olya Jaworsky is a Master of Information student in User Experience Design 
at the University of Toronto. She currently works as an Experience Designer 
in the Ontario government which has allowed her to speak with diverse users of 
government services and programs, including those from marginalized communities. 
These experiences have inspired an interest in systems design and design justice. 
Olya also holds a B.A. in Psychology from the University of Waterloo where she studied 
how design decisions in lecture material impact learning.
