Rowan O.A. Munson (he/they) is a PhD student at the Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto. 
His research interests focus on reconnecting technology to people, place, 
and planet. He is particularly interested in methods that are participatory, that broaden perspectives 
beyond WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) contexts, and that bridge 
academic theory and industry practice to create real-world impact.

Previously, Rowan managed social research projects for UK Government agencies and charities, 
and published and lectured in Health and Social Care. He has advocated for policy changes to 
address social and environmental injustices and continues to engage in advocacy efforts to 
drive meaningful change. He holds an MSc in Behavioural and Data Science from the 
University of Warwick, UK; and a BA in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics from the 
University of Oxford, UK.

When not immersed in research, Rowan enjoys exploring art galleries, going on country walks, 
and enjoying a good novel with a cup of herbal tea.
