The Just Sustainability Design Lab at University of Toronto’s Faculty of Information 
invites you to join us for an online workshop session on "Computing and AI Through the Lens of Degrowth" 
on March 21, 2025 from 10am-12pm ET. 

Degrowth is a coherent framework for reorganizing social and economic relations<sup>(1–4)</sup> that 
has significant implications for the role and meaning of technology development<sup>(5,6)</sup>, including in computing<sup>(7)</sup>. 
The field of computing is now beginning to grapple with degrowth and post-growth<sup>(8,9)</sup> perspectives (e.g. an upcoming 
[CHI workshop](https://pointed-waterlily-f95.notion.site/Advancing-Post-growth-HCI-15dec6ab184b809b8692ec6a3d578089) 
and the [LIMITS workshops](https://computingwithinlimits.org/2025/)).

In this informal workshop, we bring degrowth perspectives to bear on information technology and computing, 
including AI. We will briefly share recent research from the JSD lab on *Limits to AI Growth* [(preprint)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17980v1) and 
preliminary results on modelling the impact of AI *on* planetary Limits to Growth, then frame the conversation 
around ‘releasing technology from growth’ and open the discussion. We welcome further brief talks, lightning talks, 
or discussion prompts around the intersection of degrowth and computing.

The main purpose of this workshop is to foster a conversation about what it means to take a degrowth 
lens to computing and IT, including AI, and to make new connections between researchers who are 
interested in these questions. 

Please register here for the workshop: [https://forms.office.com/r/nhZ7tmNnnr](https://forms.office.com/r/nhZ7tmNnnr).

The workshop itself is not an introduction to the framework of degrowth - we organize the 
conversation with the idea that everyone is familiar with it. But we will preface the main workshop 
session with a half-hour “Ask me Anything about Degrowth” session in which Christoph would do his best to 
respond to any questions you have. Please indicate your interest in attending the AMA, in the [registration form](https://forms.office.com/r/nhZ7tmNnnr).


**Agenda:**
1. *Optional:* AMA about degrowth (9:30-10:00am, Christoph)
2. Workshop introduction (10:00-10:20am, Christoph)
3. Research talks (4) and discussion (10:20-11:20am)
	- Limits to AI Growth (Eshta Bhardwaj)
	- Impact of AI on Limits to Growth (Nara Guliyeva)
	- Degrowth: Releasing Tech from Growth (Christoph Becker)
	- Cooperative Approaches for Data Platforms (Nadia Mariyan Smith and Nils Bonfils)
4. Other research, lightning talks, discussion (11:20-11:45am)
5. Wrap up: what’s next (11:45am-12:00pm)
6. *Optional:* Stay and chat (12:00-12:30pm)

**Eshta Bhardwaj:** Eshta Bhardwaj is a PhD student at the Faculty of Information studying 
data practices in machine learning. Her research interests include examining how
techniques from data curation can improve data practices to increase accountability, transparency, and make ML model development more sustainable 
and resource-efficient. In this talk, she presents her 
recent [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17980v1) which is a systemic analysis of the AI scaling landscape 
and its limiting factors (e.g., data availability) using the modelling constructs of system dynamics.  

**Nara Guliyeva:** Nara Guliyeva is currently a master’s student majoring in 
Human-Centered Data Science at the iSchool. She holds a Master’s degree from Columbia University and 
has worked at the United Nations Development Programme, focusing on innovation and sustainability. Her research explores how AI growth influence 
future-forward projections within the World3 Model, which examines long-term resource constraints, pioneered by the “The Limits to Growth” study. 
She investigates how AI-driven advancements—reliant on energy-intensive data centers, finite raw materials, and extensive financial investments—create feedback 
loops that may accelerate resource depletion and pollution. In this talk, she examines the role of AI growth in affecting World3 Model projections and invites 
discussion on incorporating AI-driven trends into World3 modeling.

**Christoph Becker:** Christoph Becker is Full Professor at the Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto, where he leads the Just Sustainability Design lab, 
a Fellow of the SDG Scholars Academy at the University of Toronto, and a member of the School of the Environment. His transdisciplinary program of research in responsible 
computing helps enact meaningful and lasting change in computing research and practice to meet the urgent need for sustainability and social justice. 

**Nadia Mariyan Smith:** Nadia Mariyan Smith is a master’s student specializing in User Experience Design at the Faculty of Information. 
With a background in community work, they are interested in justice-oriented, more-than-human design approaches that emphasize collective well-being and ecological 
sustainability. In this talk, they will discuss a project they are working on with Christoph Becker and Nils Bonfils on determining the feasibility of a 
data platform cooperative for people living with diabetes.

**Nils Bonfils:** Nils is a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at UofT. 
His research interest lies at the interesection of Computer Science, STS and the Environment. His current research is about 
improving current data about historical flood events in the GTA by leveraging digital newspaper archives, furthermore this project allows 
him to think about different ways of understanding and respresenting data bout floods. Exploring alterities has always been a important aspect of research for him.
