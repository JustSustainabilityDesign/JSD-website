The Just Sustainability Design Lab at University of Toronto’s Faculty of Information 
invites you to join us for an online workshop session on "Computing and AI Through the Lens of Degrowth" 
on March 21, 2025 from 10am-12pm ET. 

Degrowth is a coherent framework for reorganizing social and economic relations<sup>(1–4)</sup> that 
has significant implications for the role and meaning of technology development<sup>(5,6)</sup>, including in computing<sup>(7)</sup>. 
The field of computing is now beginning to grapple with degrowth and post-growth<sup>(8,9)</sup> perspectives (e.g. an upcoming 
[CHI workshop](https://pointed-waterlily-f95.notion.site/Advancing-Post-growth-HCI-15dec6ab184b809b8692ec6a3d578089) 
and the [LIMITS workshops](https://computingwithinlimits.org/2025/)).

In this informal workshop, we bring degrowth perspectives to bear on information technology and computing, 
including AI. We will briefly share recent research from the JSD lab on *Limits to AI Growth* [(preprint)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17980v1) and 
preliminary results on modelling the impact of AI *on* planetary Limits to Growth, then frame the conversation 
around ‘releasing technology from growth’ and open the discussion. We welcome further brief talks, lightning talks, 
or discussion prompts around the intersection of degrowth and computing.

The main purpose of this workshop is to foster a conversation about what it means to take a degrowth 
lens to computing and IT, including AI, and to make new connections between researchers who are 
interested in these questions. 

The workshop itself is not an introduction to the framework of degrowth - we organize the 
conversation with the idea that everyone is familiar with it. But we can preface the main workshop 
session with a half-hour “Ask me Anything about Degrowth” session in which Christoph would do his best to 
respond to any questions you have. Please let us know if you are interested in that.


**Agenda:**
0. *Optional:* AMA about degrowth (9:30-10:00am, Christoph)
1. Workshop introduction (10:00-10:20am, Christoph)
2. Research talks (4) and discussion (10:20-11:20am)
	1. Limits to AI Growth (Eshta)
	2. Impact of AI on Limits to Growth (Nara)
	3. Degrowth: Releasing Tech from Growth (Christoph)
	4. Cooperative Approaches for Data Platforms (Nadia and Nils)
3. Other research, lightning talks, discussion (11:20-11:45am)
4. Wrap up: what’s next (11:45am-12:00pm)
5. *Optional:* Stay and chat (12:00-12:30pm)
