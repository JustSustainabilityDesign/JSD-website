My book "Insolvent" was reviewed at length in the Journal of Responsible Technology by a very capable team of researchers. 
Their conclusion: "Overall, Insolvent renders great service to the social sciencesâ€™ understanding of computing as an important science and technology and articulates a fierce reflexive critique of computer science from within the field"

But read the extended analysis [there](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrt.2024.100092)! I'm delighted by the deep engagement with the book's arguments and I agree with the reviewers that there is a lot of promising work ahead.
