**COMPASS Workshop: Humour as Resistance: Creative Approaches to Data Center Accountability**\
**July 22 from 2:00-6:00pm at MY330 (Myhal Centre)**

**Call for Participation:**
Join us for an interactive workshop that delves into the ecological and social impacts of data centers, the backbone of AI infrastructure. 
As AI scales up, so does the need for data centers, which has significant environmental and social repercussions often obscured by Big Tech. This workshop aims to 
illuminate these impacts and foster collective organizing around the harms caused by data centers.

In the first half, we will explore the local and global implications of data centers, encouraging participants to get to know the 
impacts of particular data centers in place. We will present key findings on the environmental degradation and social injustices linked to data center operations, 
highlighting the voices of grassroots organizers who have documented these harms. 

The second half of the workshop will embrace creativity as a tool for resistance. We will work together, using humour, satire, and art to convey the 
increasing social and environmental resource consumption taking place in data centers. Together, we will brainstorm and develop visual materials that convey these messages, transforming despair into collective agency.

We invite activists, researchers, and community members to contribute their perspectives and creativity. By participating, you will help build a network of 
resistance against the negative impacts of data center infrastructure, fostering a sense of community and shared purpose.
