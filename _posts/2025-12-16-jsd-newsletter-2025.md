Welcome to the first edition of the JSD Lab newsletter. This year has been full of creative experimentation, collaborative research, and new local and international partnerships. We’re excited to share highlights from our community.

![Not all is work at the JSD. In 2025, we also gathered for picnics, hikes and games!](images/fall_2025.jpg)


## Welcome to the Lab!

This fall, the JSD Lab welcomed four graduate students.

**Nadia Mariyan Smith** is a PhD student in the Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto. With a background in community work, they are interested in justice-oriented, more-than-human design approaches that emphasize collective well-being and ecological sustainability. Nadia holds a Master of Information in User Experience Design and a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Photography.

**Nils Bonfils** is a PhD student in the Faculty of Information at UofT. After completing his BSc and MSc degrees in Computer Science at EPFL, he worked in the banking and telecom industries as a Software Engineer for a few years. This allowed him to recognize the proportions and unsustainability of modern technological trends. He decided to pursue a PhD to explore and understand alternative ontologies in which information technology practices can be made more sustainable. His research interests span across Information, Computer Science, STS and the Environment. Other subtopics of interest are permacomputing, technology otherwise, convivial computing and digital degrowth.

**Rowan O.A. Munson** is a PhD student at the Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto. His research interests focus on reconnecting technology to people, place, and planet. He is particularly interested in methods that are participatory, that broaden perspectives beyond WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) contexts, and that bridge academic theory and industry practice to create real-world impact.

Previously, Rowan managed social research projects for UK Government agencies and charities, and published and lectured in Health and Social Care. He has advocated for policy changes to address social and environmental injustices and continues to engage in advocacy efforts to drive meaningful change. He holds an MSc in Behavioural and Data Science from the University of Warwick, UK; and a BA in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics from the University of Oxford, UK.

**Cristian Velasquez** is an artist, photographer, and specialist in digital communication strategies and content production. He is currently pursuing a Master of Information at the University of Toronto, where he also leads communications and engagement for both the Just Sustainability Design Lab and the Knowledge Media Design Institute.

Cristian’s artistic practice centers on documentation, making marginalized cultural practices and community histories visible. Over the past two years, he has been developing an ongoing visual archive of Toronto’s nightlife and culture. He has previously worked at the University of Toronto Scarborough Library, where he led initiatives to mobilize digital collections. In Colombia, he worked at the Ministry of Culture, contributing to the design and implementation of inclusion and diversity policies, advancing national literacy initiatives, and supporting public education and engagement.

## International Graduate Students

The JSD Lab is happy to host two International Graduate students in 2025.

**Victoria Landau** investigates how cultural and research institutions approach digital sustainability, preservation, and curation. Her doctoral research at the University of Basel examines how institutional decision-making shapes heritage collections, both analog and digital, and how open standards support long-term access and preservation. We are grateful for the insight and energy she brought to our community. Wishing you continued success on your PhD journey, Victoria!

**Verena Müller** is a PhD candidate at the Technical University of Munich whose work connects technology, law, and environmental sustainability. After completing her degree in Law, she joined the Professorship for Law, Innovation and Legal Design at TUM as a researcher and doctoral candidate. Her research spans the intersection of technology, society, and regulation. Her current project focuses on AI regulation and environmental sustainability, exploring innovative approaches to integrate law and AI practices to promote “Sustainability by Design.” Verena joins us for Fall 2025 and Winter 2026.

## Achievements and Collaborations

**“Near Data” and “Far Data” for Urban Sustainability: How Do Community Advocates Envision Data Intermediaries?”** received a Best Paper Award at ACM CSCW 2025.

Authored by Han Qiao, Siyi Wu, and Christoph Becker, the paper explores how community organizations navigate and negotiate data, ranging from local, lived information (“near data”) to large scale, processed datasets (“far data”). The study uncovers design possibilities for tools that center community expertise in building sustainable urban futures.

This research continues through the School of Cities Urban Challenge Grant (2025–2027), in collaboration with the Visionary Communities team in Scarborough.

## Climate Change: What Is Computing’s Responsibility?

In March 2025, a group of leading practitioners, policy experts, and researchers — including Christoph Becker — convened at Dagstuhl Leibniz Center for Informatics in Germany on invitation of the ACM to examine a pressing question: What is computing’s responsibility in the current climate crisis? The resulting Dagstuhl Manifesto is a wide-ranging call for a fundamental shift in how computational systems are designed, deployed, and governed.

## Resisting GenAI and Big Tech in Higher Education

On November 25, an international panel of scholar-activists came together to examine the expanding influence of generative AI across universities and the urgent need to push back. From escalating energy and water consumption to disruptions in learning, academic integrity, and governance, the session unpacked the social, environmental, and political risks of AI’s rapid adoption.

## Two of Our Members Are Now PhD Candidates

**Eshta Bhardwaj** defended her thesis proposal titled “Adopting a Data Curation Lens for Rigorous, Reflexive, and Responsible Machine Learning Data Practices”.

**Han Qiao** defended her thesis proposal titled “Designing with Data Near and Far: Making Information Visceral for Imagining and Navigating Sustainable Futures.”

## Projects

### Save the AI: Holding Big Tech Accountable through Creativity and Humour

This February, the JSD Lab launched Save the AI, a creative campaign that turns critical insights about AI’s environmental and social impacts into engaging public materials. Thanks to collaborators across the world, the campaign is now available in nine languages.

## Toronto–Warwick Collaboration on Data Justice, Social Justice, and Sustainability

The JSD Lab (University of Toronto) and the Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies (University of Warwick) have launched a new partnership to strengthen research and PhD training at the intersection of Data Justice, Social Justice, and Sustainability.
