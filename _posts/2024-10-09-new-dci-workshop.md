The Just Sustainability Design Lab at the University of Toronto's Faculty of Information 
invites you to join us for an online open workshop session on Sustainable Neighborhoods, Sustainable Cities on October 21, 2024, from 12:30 PM to 2:30 PM.

In this workshop, we will showcase past and ongoing research projects from the lab, 
including designing urban sustainability data exploration tools, addressing psychological distance through design, 
and examining the data practices of urban sustainability advocacy groups in Toronto.

We are also excited to welcome Yifan Kong, a PhD candidate from the University of Sydneyâ€™s 
Games and Play Lab, who will present her research on storytelling, cultural heritage, and human-computer interaction.

We encourage participants to share their own ongoing research through 5-minute lightning talks, followed by a collaborative feedback session.
