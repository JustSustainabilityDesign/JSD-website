**School of Cities Urban Challenge Grant 4.0 (2025-26)**\

In collaboration with the Visionary Communities, our lab received School of Cities' [UCG 4.0 grant](https://schoolofcities.utoronto.ca/programs-opportunities/urban-challenge-grant/urban-challenge-grants-4/). Through our project, named "Centering Community in Data Ecosystems: Integrating Near Data and Far Data for Just Sustainable Neighborhoods", we will explore critical perspectives in human-computer interaction to use data to bridge the divide between local and city-wide sustainability efforts, reduce inequality, and advance democratic inclusion by advancing ways in which academics and communities can work across sectors and scales to create more just ways for cities and their residents to thrive.
