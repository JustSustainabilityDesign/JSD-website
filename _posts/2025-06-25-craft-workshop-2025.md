**FAccT'25 CRAFT: Leveraging humour, satire, and art to engage with the environmental impacts of AI**

**Session Description:**
Our interactive CRAFT workshop session uses satire and creative expression to 
facilitate and strengthen collective organizing around the environmental damages caused by AI systems.

The JSD lab has developed a distributed satirical campaign to [Savethe.AI](https://savethe.ai/) which uses humour 
to connect individuals’ and communities’ needs for Earth’s resources with the evidence 
of just how much of these resources are now being claimed for the data centres running generative AI. 
By connecting our thirst with a data center’s cooling system, the campaign addresses psychological 
distance: it is very hard to relate personally to the distant data centers where generative AI models do their work. 

In our CRAFT workshop session, we will build on the satirical angle and facilitate 
a creative humorous engagement with questions of individual agency, community experiences, and 
collective resistance. We collectively explore ecological and social impacts of data centers 
and platforms that are already felt by diverse communities. These impacts vary greatly in place and 
time and are documented primarily by the tireless work of organizers, civil society, and academics, 
while being obfuscated by the companies creating the situation. 

Our workshop invites participants to collectively develop their own humorous ideas and materials 
that express the absurdity of those harms being taken for granted and denied. 

Through this creative process, 
we hope to achieve both a collective learning process, 
foster a sense of collective agency, possibly develop visual 
materials that the community can use, and contribute to community 
building in the face of the issues of accountability, transparency, and 
ecological and social harms that result from rampant AI.
