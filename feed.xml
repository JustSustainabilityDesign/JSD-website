<p>The Just Sustainability Design Lab at University of Toronto’s Faculty of Information 
invites you to join us for an online workshop session on “Computing and AI Through the Lens of Degrowth” 
on March 21, 2025 from 10am-12pm ET.</p>

<p>Degrowth is a coherent framework for reorganizing social and economic relations<sup>(1–4)</sup> that 
has significant implications for the role and meaning of technology development<sup>(5,6)</sup>, including in computing<sup>(7)</sup>. 
The field of computing is now beginning to grapple with degrowth and post-growth<sup>(8,9)</sup> perspectives (e.g. an upcoming 
<a href="https://pointed-waterlily-f95.notion.site/Advancing-Post-growth-HCI-15dec6ab184b809b8692ec6a3d578089">CHI workshop</a> 
and the <a href="https://computingwithinlimits.org/2025/">LIMITS workshops</a>).</p>

<p>In this informal workshop, we bring degrowth perspectives to bear on information technology and computing, 
including AI. We will briefly share recent research from the JSD lab on <em>Limits to AI Growth</em> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17980v1">(preprint)</a> and 
preliminary results on modelling the impact of AI <em>on</em> planetary Limits to Growth, then frame the conversation 
around ‘releasing technology from growth’ and open the discussion. We welcome further brief talks, lightning talks, 
or discussion prompts around the intersection of degrowth and computing.</p>

<p>The main purpose of this workshop is to foster a conversation about what it means to take a degrowth 
lens to computing and IT, including AI, and to make new connections between researchers who are 
interested in these questions.</p>

<p>Please register here for the workshop: <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/nhZ7tmNnnr">https://forms.office.com/r/nhZ7tmNnnr</a>.</p>

<p>The workshop itself is not an introduction to the framework of degrowth - we organize the 
conversation with the idea that everyone is familiar with it. But we will preface the main workshop 
session with a half-hour “Ask me Anything about Degrowth” session in which Christoph would do his best to 
respond to any questions you have. Please indicate your interest in attending the AMA, in the <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/nhZ7tmNnnr">registration form</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Eshta Bhardwaj:</strong> Eshta Bhardwaj is a PhD student at the Faculty of Information studying 
data practices in machine learning. Her research interests include examining how
techniques from data curation can improve data practices to increase accountability, transparency, and make ML model development more sustainable 
and resource-efficient. In this talk, she presents her 
recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17980v1">paper</a> which is a systemic analysis of the AI scaling landscape 
and its limiting factors (e.g., data availability) using the modelling constructs of system dynamics.</p>

<p><strong>Nara Guliyeva:</strong> Nara Guliyeva is currently a master’s student majoring in 
Human-Centered Data Science at the iSchool. She holds a Master’s degree from Columbia University and 
has worked at the United Nations Development Programme, focusing on innovation and sustainability. Her research explores how AI growth influence 
future-forward projections within the World3 Model, which examines long-term resource constraints, pioneered by the “The Limits to Growth” study. 
She investigates how AI-driven advancements—reliant on energy-intensive data centers, finite raw materials, and extensive financial investments—create feedback 
loops that may accelerate resource depletion and pollution. In this talk, she examines the role of AI growth in affecting World3 Model projections and invites 
discussion on incorporating AI-driven trends into World3 modeling.</p>

<p><strong>Christoph Becker:</strong> Christoph Becker is Full Professor at the Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto, where he leads the Just Sustainability Design lab, 
a Fellow of the SDG Scholars Academy at the University of Toronto, and a member of the School of the Environment. His transdisciplinary program of research in responsible 
computing helps enact meaningful and lasting change in computing research and practice to meet the urgent need for sustainability and social justice.</p>

<p><strong>Nadia Mariyan Smith:</strong> Nadia Mariyan Smith is a master’s student specializing in User Experience Design at the Faculty of Information. 
With a background in community work, they are interested in justice-oriented, more-than-human design approaches that emphasize collective well-being and ecological 
sustainability. In this talk, they will discuss a project they are working on with Christoph Becker and Nils Bonfils on determining the feasibility of a 
data platform cooperative for people living with diabetes.</p>

<p><strong>Nils Bonfils:</strong> Nils is a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at UofT. 
His research interest lies at the intersection of Computer Science, STS and the Environment. His current research is about 
improving current data about historical flood events in the GTA by leveraging digital newspaper archives, furthermore this project allows

data intermediaries are crucial stakeholders in facilitating data access and use. 
Community advocates live in these sites of social injustices and opportunities for change. 
Highly experienced in working with data to enact change, they offer distinctive insights on data practices and tools. 
This paper examines the unique perspectives that community advocates offer on data intermediaries. Based on interviews with 17 
advocates working with 23 grassroots and nonprofit organizations, we propose the quality of “near” and “far” to be seriously considered in 
data intermediaries’ works and articulate advocates’ vision of connecting “near data” and “far data.” To pursue this vision, 
we identified three pathways for data intermediaries: align data exploration with ways of storytelling, communicate context and 
uncertainties, and decenter artifacts for relationship building. These pathways help data intermediaries to put data feminism 
into practice, surface design opportunities and tensions, and raise key questions for supporting the pursuit of the Right to the City.</p>

The field of machine learning is increasingly observing the importance of data curation to the advancement of both applications 
and fundamental understanding of machine learning models – evidenced not least by the creation of the Datasets and Benchmarks track itself. 
Our work provides an analysis of recent dataset development practices at NeurIPS through the lens of data curation. 
We present an evaluation framework for dataset documentation, consisting of a rubric and toolkit developed through a thorough 
literature review of data curation principles. We use the framework to systematically assess the strengths and weaknesses in 
current dataset development practices of 60 datasets published in the NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks track from 2021-2023. 
Our results indicate greater need for documentation about environmental footprint, ethical 
considerations, and data management. In this work, we suggest targeted strategies and resources to improve documentation in these areas and 
provide recommendations for the NeurIPS peer-review process that prioritize rigorous data curation in ML.</p>

<p><strong>Eshta Bhardwaj:</strong> Eshta Bhardwaj is a PhD student at the Faculty of Information studying 
data practices in machine learning. Her research interests include examining how dataset development 
processes within machine learning research can be improved with the adoption of data curation principles and 
concerns of fairness, accountability, and transparency in data work. In this talk, she will present two phases of an 
ongoing <a href="https://justsustainabilitydesign.org/datacurationinML/">research project</a> which establishes how data curation 
principles can be applied to curate ML datasets.</p>

<p><strong>Ciara Zogheib:</strong> Ciara Zogheib is a PhD student at the Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto. 
Her current research explores the information practices of cross-domain data work. More broadly, her research interests 
are in data studies, information practice, and interdisciplinarity. In the talk, she discusses that within the context of 
interdisciplinary and collaborative research, researchers often talk about ‘integrating’ data and information across domains. 
Pragmatically, though, the activities that comprise cross-domain integration are often overlooked and not documented as ‘methods’ 
for evaluation and critique. Thus she presents how we might treat cross-domain integration as a data practice, and invites attendees to 
engage with an in-progress question guide with the goal of documenting the activities associated with this practice.</p>

<p><strong>Syed Ashfaq Hussain:</strong> He is a <a href="https://www.arc.ed.tum.de/ai/team/syed-ashfaq-hussain-shah/">research associate and PhD candidate</a> 
at the chair of Architectural Informatics at 
Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany. His <a href="https://portal.fis.tum.de/en/persons/syed-ashfaq-hussain">research interests</a> 
include research data management, social, and 
entrepreneurial aspects of digitisation and modern IT systems. In his talk titled “Sustainable research data management 
planning”, he presents a systematic approach and topics of research data management from a strategy and policy-making perspective 
on the example of a large collaborative research center. He also discusses the foundation for dynamic data management plans in 
collaborative virtual research environment.</p>
