Because all outcomes from policies relevant to climate change occur at a distance, decision-makers experience so-called ‘psychological distance’ to environmental decisions in terms of space, time, 
social identity, and hypotheticality. Since policy decisions to achieve a safe planetary space are urgently needed for immediate transition, we need a design practice that takes into account how 
psychological distance affects cognition and decision-making. Our paper explores the role of alternative design approaches in developing visualizations used for climate policymaking. Our paper 
lays out how future research on the impacts of alternative design approaches on psychological distance can make data used for policy decisions more tangible and visceral. In the paper, we synthesize 
literature from environmental psychology and social and cognitive psychology to explore how the design of decision tools can leverage approaches like speculative design and data visceralization to invoke 
affective responses to environmental decisions to help traverse psychological distance. It was accepted at the Tenth 
Workshop on Computing within Limits (LIMITS 2024). The paper can be found <a href="https://computingwithinlimits.org/2024/papers/limits2024-bhardwaj-psychological-distance.pdf">here</a> and the recorded talk

<p><strong>Compensation:</strong> Stipend or casual RA contract ($35/hr)</p>

<p><strong>Effort:</strong> about ~50-100h (some flexibility)</p>

<p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Stage 1 is time sensitive, to be completed by mid December (&lt;20 hours). Stage 2 is more flexible and will take place in the first half of winter term.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong>
Our study evaluates existing dataset development processes within machine learning research and develops a method for increasing transparency and improving the documentation of dataset development.</p>

<p>We are looking for 2-4 individuals with a research background in fields related to machine learning, data science, or computer science, who are interested in taking a closer look into the data sets used in machine learning and examine their documentation.
You will learn about data curation in machine learning and its role in fairness, bias, and accountability. You will review, classify, and evaluate datasets and their documentation from published research in a machine learning conference. 
Successful candidates will be invited to become co-authors of the resulting research paper(s).</p>

<p><strong>Candidate Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Must be familiar with and comfortable reading machine learning research papers</li>
  <li>Has a background in machine learning, data science, or computer science</li>
  <li>Preferred: Good knowledge of benchmarking in ML</li>
  <li>Preferred: Current graduate student in a field related to the study</li>
</ul>

<p>Interested candidates should contact Prof. Christoph Becker at <a href="mailto:christoph.becker@utoronto.ca">christoph.becker@utoronto.ca</a> with their CV/resume and a statement of interest right away.
Applicants will be considered on a rolling basis.</p>]]></content><author><name>christoph-becker</name></author><category term="closed" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[For an evaluation of data curation in machine learning, conducted by Eshta Bhardwaj, Christoph Becker, and Tegan Rajkumar-Maharaj, we are seeking up to four RA positions immediately, for the coming months.]]></summary></entry></feed>
