Online, March 21, 2025 
Pre-session 9:30-10:00am ET
Workshop 10:00am-12:00pm ET
Stay and chat till 12:30pm ET</p>

<p>The Just Sustainability Design Lab at University of Toronto’s Faculty of Information 
invites you to join us for an online workshop session on “Computing and AI Through the Lens of Degrowth” 
on March 21, 2025 from 10am-12pm ET.</p>

<p>Degrowth is a coherent framework for reorganizing social and economic relations^(1–4) that 
has significant implications for the role and meaning of technology development^(5,6), including in computing^(7). 
The field of computing is now beginning to grapple with degrowth and post-growth^(8,9) perspectives (e.g. an upcoming 
<a href="https://pointed-waterlily-f95.notion.site/Advancing-Post-growth-HCI-15dec6ab184b809b8692ec6a3d578089">CHI workshop</a> 
and the <a href="https://computingwithinlimits.org/2025/">LIMITS workshops</a>).</p>

<p>In this informal workshop, we bring degrowth perspectives to bear on information technology and computing, 
including AI. We will briefly share recent research from the JSD lab on <em>Limits to AI Growth</em> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17980v1">(preprint)</a> and 
preliminary results on modelling the impact of AI <em>on</em> planetary Limits to Growth, then frame the conversation 
around ‘releasing technology from growth’ and open the discussion. We welcome further brief talks, lightning talks, 
or discussion prompts around the intersection of degrowth and computing.</p>

<p>The main purpose of this workshop is to foster a conversation about what it means to take a degrowth 
lens to computing and IT, including AI, and to make new connections between researchers who are 
interested in these questions.</p>

<p>The workshop itself is not an introduction to the framework of degrowth - we organize the 
conversation with the idea that everyone is familiar with it. But we can preface the main workshop 
session with a half-hour “Ask me Anything about Degrowth” session in which Christoph would do his best to 
respond to any questions you have. Please let us know if you are interested in that.</p>

<p>Agenda:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Optional: AMA about degrowth (9:30-10:00am, Christoph)</li>
  <li>Workshop introduction (10:00-10:20am, Christoph)</li>

data intermediaries are crucial stakeholders in facilitating data access and use. 
Community advocates live in these sites of social injustices and opportunities for change. 
Highly experienced in working with data to enact change, they offer distinctive insights on data practices and tools. 
This paper examines the unique perspectives that community advocates offer on data intermediaries. Based on interviews with 17 
advocates working with 23 grassroots and nonprofit organizations, we propose the quality of “near” and “far” to be seriously considered in 
data intermediaries’ works and articulate advocates’ vision of connecting “near data” and “far data.” To pursue this vision, 
we identified three pathways for data intermediaries: align data exploration with ways of storytelling, communicate context and 
uncertainties, and decenter artifacts for relationship building. These pathways help data intermediaries to put data feminism 
into practice, surface design opportunities and tensions, and raise key questions for supporting the pursuit of the Right to the City.</p>

The field of machine learning is increasingly observing the importance of data curation to the advancement of both applications 
and fundamental understanding of machine learning models – evidenced not least by the creation of the Datasets and Benchmarks track itself. 
Our work provides an analysis of recent dataset development practices at NeurIPS through the lens of data curation. 
We present an evaluation framework for dataset documentation, consisting of a rubric and toolkit developed through a thorough 
literature review of data curation principles. We use the framework to systematically assess the strengths and weaknesses in 
current dataset development practices of 60 datasets published in the NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks track from 2021-2023. 
Our results indicate greater need for documentation about environmental footprint, ethical 
considerations, and data management. In this work, we suggest targeted strategies and resources to improve documentation in these areas and 
provide recommendations for the NeurIPS peer-review process that prioritize rigorous data curation in ML.</p>

<p>It was accepted at The Thirty-Eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) Datasets &amp; Benchmarks track as a spotlight poster.

<p><strong>Eshta Bhardwaj:</strong> Eshta Bhardwaj is a PhD student at the Faculty of Information studying 
data practices in machine learning. Her research interests include examining how dataset development 
processes within machine learning research can be improved with the adoption of data curation principles and 
concerns of fairness, accountability, and transparency in data work. In this talk, she will present two phases of an 
ongoing <a href="https://justsustainabilitydesign.org/datacurationinML/">research project</a> which establishes how data curation 
principles can be applied to curate ML datasets.</p>

<p><strong>Ciara Zogheib:</strong> Ciara Zogheib is a PhD student at the Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto. 
Her current research explores the information practices of cross-domain data work. More broadly, her research interests 
are in data studies, information practice, and interdisciplinarity. In the talk, she discusses that within the context of 
interdisciplinary and collaborative research, researchers often talk about ‘integrating’ data and information across domains. 
Pragmatically, though, the activities that comprise cross-domain integration are often overlooked and not documented as ‘methods’ 
for evaluation and critique. Thus she presents how we might treat cross-domain integration as a data practice, and invites attendees to 
engage with an in-progress question guide with the goal of documenting the activities associated with this practice.</p>

<p><strong>Syed Ashfaq Hussain:</strong> He is a <a href="https://www.arc.ed.tum.de/ai/team/syed-ashfaq-hussain-shah/">research associate and PhD candidate</a> 
at the chair of Architectural Informatics at 
Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany. His <a href="https://portal.fis.tum.de/en/persons/syed-ashfaq-hussain">research interests</a> 
include research data management, social, and 
entrepreneurial aspects of digitisation and modern IT systems. In his talk titled “Sustainable research data management 
planning”, he presents a systematic approach and topics of research data management from a strategy and policy-making perspective 
on the example of a large collaborative research center. He also discusses the foundation for dynamic data management plans in 
collaborative virtual research environment.</p>
