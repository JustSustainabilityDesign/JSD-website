<h2 id="this-fall-the-jsd-lab-welcomed-four-graduate-students">This fall, the JSD Lab welcomed four graduate students.</h2>

<p><strong>Nadia Mariyan Smith</strong> is a PhD student in the Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto. With a background in community work, they are interested in justice-oriented, more-than-human design approaches that emphasize collective well-being and ecological sustainability. Nadia holds a Master of Information in User Experience Design and a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Photography.</p>

<p><strong>Nils Bonfils</strong> is a PhD student in the Faculty of Information at UofT. After completing his BSc and MSc degrees in Computer Science at EPFL, he worked in the banking and telecom industries as a Software Engineer for a few years. This allowed him to recognize the proportions and unsustainability of modern technological trends. He decided to pursue a PhD to explore and understand alternative ontologies in which information technology practices can be made more sustainable. His research interests span across Information, Computer Science, STS and the Environment. Other subtopics of interest are permacomputing, technology otherwise, convivial computing and digital degrowth.</p>

<p><strong>Rowan O.A. Munson</strong> is a PhD student at the Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto. His research interests focus on reconnecting technology to people, place, and planet. He is particularly interested in methods that are participatory, that broaden perspectives beyond WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) contexts, and that bridge academic theory and industry practice to create real-world impact. Previously, Rowan managed social research projects for UK Government agencies and charities, and published and lectured in Health and Social Care. He has advocated for policy changes to address social and environmental injustices and continues to engage in advocacy efforts to drive meaningful change. He holds an MSc in Behavioural and Data Science from the University of Warwick, UK; and a BA in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics from the University of Oxford, UK.</p>

<p><strong>Cristian Velasquez</strong> is an artist, photographer, and specialist in digital communication strategies and content production. He is currently pursuing a Master of Information at the University of Toronto, where he also leads communications and engagement for both the Just Sustainability Design Lab and the Knowledge Media Design Institute. Cristian’s artistic practice centers on documentation, making marginalized cultural practices and community histories visible. Over the past two years, he has been developing an ongoing visual archive of Toronto’s nightlife and culture. He has previously worked at the University of Toronto Scarborough Library, where he led initiatives to mobilize digital collections. In Colombia, he worked at the Ministry of Culture, contributing to the design and implementation of inclusion and diversity policies, advancing national literacy initiatives, and supporting public education and engagement.</p>

<h2 id="international-graduate-students">International Graduate Students</h2>

<p>The JSD Lab is happy to host two International Graduate students in 2025.</p>

<p><strong>Victoria Landau</strong> investigates how cultural and research institutions approach digital sustainability, preservation, and curation. Her doctoral research at the University of Basel examines how institutional decision-making shapes heritage collections, both analog and digital, and how open standards support long-term access and preservation. We are grateful for the insight and energy she brought to our community. Wishing you continued success on your PhD journey, Victoria!</p>

<p><strong>Verena Müller</strong> is a PhD candidate at the Technical University of Munich whose work connects technology, law, and environmental sustainability. After completing her degree in Law, she joined the Professorship for Law, Innovation and Legal Design at TUM as a researcher and doctoral candidate. Her research spans the intersection of technology, society, and regulation. Her current project focuses on AI regulation and environmental sustainability, exploring innovative approaches to integrate law and AI practices to promote “Sustainability by Design.” Verena joins us for Fall 2025 and Winter 2026.</p>

<h3 id="near-data-and-far-data-for-urban-sustainability-how-do-community-advocates-envision-data-intermediaries-received-a-best-paper-award-at-acm-cscw-2025"><strong>“Near Data” and “Far Data” for Urban Sustainability: How Do Community Advocates Envision Data Intermediaries?”</strong> received a Best Paper Award at ACM CSCW 2025.</h3>

<p>Authored by Han Qiao, Siyi Wu, and Christoph Becker, the paper explores how community organizations navigate and negotiate data, ranging from local, lived information (“near data”) to large scale, processed datasets (“far data”). The study uncovers design possibilities for tools that center community expertise in building sustainable urban futures.</p>

<p>PhD Candidate Han Qiao, who presented the work, grounds her doctoral research in a deceptively simple question: How do our everyday encounters with data influence the way we imagine—and shape—the cities around us? Her dissertation examines how our interactions with data inform our relationships to physical spaces and our collective imaginaries of urban futures.</p>

<p>This research continues through the School of Cities Urban Challenge Grant (2025–2027), in collaboration with the Visionary Communities team in Scarborough. Together, we are developing practices that make heavily processed (far) data relevant for local knowledge contexts and aspirations, and re-embed community generated knowledges and aspirations (near data) in a far-data context to help municipal decision-makers better recognize, value, and act upon the insights and aspirations of community-based changemakers.</p>

<h3 id="climate-change-what-is-computings-responsibility-reflections-from-the-dagstuhl-perspectives-workshop">Climate Change: What Is Computing’s Responsibility? Reflections from the Dagstuhl Perspectives Workshop</h3>

<p>In March 2025, a group of leading practitioners, policy experts, and researchers — including Christoph Becker — convened at Dagstuhl Leibniz Center for Informatics in Germany on invitation of the ACM to examine a pressing question: What is computing’s responsibility in the current climate crisis? The resulting Dagstuhl Manifesto is a wide-ranging call for a fundamental shift in how computational systems are designed, deployed, and governed.</p>

<p>The Manifesto challenges the assumption that efficiency gains or technological optimism alone can offset the rapidly escalating environmental impacts of digital infrastructures. Instead, it argues for reorienting computing toward sufficiency, long-term durability, human rights, and planetary boundaries. It underscores the need for transparent environmental assessments, a stronger role for computing professionals in shaping digital policy, and a renewed commitment to climate-conscious education and practice. For those working at the intersection of technology, sustainability, and justice, this document offers an essential framework for the years ahead.</p>

<h3 id="resisting-genai-and-big-tech-in-higher-education">Resisting GenAI and Big Tech in Higher Education</h3>

<p>On November 25, an international panel of scholar-activists came together to examine the expanding influence of generative AI across universities and the urgent need to push back. From escalating energy and water consumption to disruptions in learning, academic integrity, and governance, the session unpacked the social, environmental, and political risks of AI’s rapid adoption.</p>

<p>Speakers included Christoph Becker (University of Toronto), Mary Finley-Brook (University of Richmond), Dan McQuillan (Goldsmiths, University of London), Sinéad Sheehan (University of Galway), Jennie Stephens (National University of Ireland Maynooth), and Paul Lachapelle (Montana State University). They shared concrete examples of resistance and refusal, offering pathways for collective action and for challenging the narrative that AI’s expansion is inevitable.</p>

<h3 id="save-the-ai-holding-big-tech-accountable-through-creativity-and-humour">Save the AI: Holding Big Tech Accountable through Creativity and Humour</h3>

<p>This February, the JSD Lab launched Save the AI, a creative campaign that turns critical insights about AI’s environmental and social impacts into engaging public materials. Thanks to collaborators across the world, the campaign is now available in nine languages.</p>

<p>Save the AI uses humour as a bridge—connecting people’s basic needs such as clean water, electricity, and air to the resource-intensive infrastructures powering AI. By bridging the psychological distance between everyday life and far-off data centers, the project invites people to rethink the hidden footprints of today’s technological systems.</p>

<p>Our team presented this work at ACM FAccT 2025, COMPASS 2025 and KDD 2025.</p>

<h2 id="torontowarwick-collaboration-on-data-justice-social-justice-and-sustainability">Toronto–Warwick Collaboration on Data Justice, Social Justice, and Sustainability</h2>

<p>The JSD Lab (University of Toronto) and the Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies (University of Warwick) have launched a new partnership to strengthen research and PhD training at the intersection of Data Justice, Social Justice, and Sustainability. Funded through the 2025–2026 University of Toronto–University of Warwick Joint Seed Fund, the initiative is led by Dr. Siddharth De Souza and Professor Christoph Becker, and organized by PhD Student Rowan O.A. Munson.</p>

<p>Emerging data technologies often exacerbate social inequity and climate change, two of the most pressing challenges facing the world today, with their capacities to digitally monitor, sort, and control individuals and communities while consuming vast human and planetary resources in the process. The Universities of Toronto and Warwick are preparing our PhD students to take a leading role in addressing these global challenges by taking a global approach to PhD research and education that centers Data Justice, Social Justice, and Sustainability in Technology Design.</p>

<p>The project is already underway, with three workshops hosted between November and December, 2025:</p>

<p>“In which we shall question the supposed inevitability of artificial intelligence and what we might do about it.” With contributions from T.L. Cowan, Alessandro Delfanti, Noortje Marres and Sanjay Sharma.</p>

<p>“Methodological Approaches to Data Justice, Social Justice, and Sustainability.” Featuring Han Qiao, Kavin Narasimhan, Nadia Mariyan Smith and Nils Bonfils.</p>

<p>“Academic as Activist: The role of the university in facilitating social change.”
With contributions from Siddharth De Souza, Rafael Grohmann, Carlos Cámara-Menoyo, and Vera Khovanskaya.</p>

<h2 id="limits-2025-computing-within-planetary-boundaries">LIMITS 2025: Computing Within Planetary Boundaries</h2>

<p>JSD Lab Lead Christoph Becker co-chaired LIMITS 2025, a globally distributed, online-first conference focused on envisioning and enacting forms of computing that respect and operate within planetary boundaries. With over 200 participants joining from multiple continents, LIMITS continues to grow as the central venue for rethinking computing in a world of ecological and social constraints. This year LIMITS features two contributions from the JSD lab:</p>

<p>An Empirical Inquiry into Surveillance Capitalism: Web Tracking
by Nils Bonfils at LIMITS 2025</p>

<p>Nils Bonfils presented new empirical research on the mechanisms of Surveillance Capitalism as they unfold across the contemporary web. Drawing on longitudinal data from WhoTracks.Me (2017–2025) and publicly available SEC filings, the study maps the tracking practices of major tech companies—Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft. The analysis highlights Google’s pervasive presence across the web, proposes a three-tier hierarchy of GAFAM actors in the surveillance ecosystem, and identifies emerging forms of tracking designed to evade detection.
The work also reflects on the broader social and environmental costs of tracking-driven business models and points to alternative technologies, such as the Gemini protocol, that challenge extractive data practices. By grounding discussions of Surveillance Capitalism in empirical evidence, this contribution strengthens ongoing efforts to rethink digital infrastructures in more equitable and sustainable directions.</p>

<p>Exploring the World3 Model to Assess Computing’s Impact on Planetary Boundaries
by Nara Guliyeva, Eshta Bhardwaj, and Christoph Becker</p>

<p>Another contribution from the JSD Lab examined whether the updated World3-03 system dynamics model, a foundational tool first introduced in Limits to Growth, can be adapted to understand how today’s rapidly expanding computing infrastructures affect planetary boundaries.</p>

<p>With global data center development accelerating, particularly in support of AI systems, the authors asked whether World3-03 could meaningfully simulate the environmental consequences of resource-intensive computing. By integrating new AI-related variables, including data-center-driven pollution and growth trajectories, the team created an augmented scenario within the model. Their findings show that the model responds predictably to these additions, indicating that World3-03 is a viable quantitative tool for exploring how computing contributes to ecological strain. The paper outlines future research directions for using system dynamics to study the long-term environmental implications of AI and data infrastructure—supporting deeper, evidence-driven conversations about the sustainability of computing within planetary limits.</p>

<p>Professor Christoph Becker joins a collective of disabled researchers and artists in organizing Crip HCI: Cyborg Perspectives on Disability Justice. This workshop brings together medical “cyborgs”—individuals living with devices such as insulin pumps, prosthetics, pacemakers, and sensors—to reflect on the politics, vulnerabilities, and creativity embedded in cyborg life.</p>

<p>Grounded in disability justice, crip theory, and lived experience, the workshop challenges extractive, techno-solutionist approaches and centers the knowledge of disabled people as foundational to imagining new sociotechnical futures. Participants will share work, build community, and explore how cyborg perspectives can reshape research, design, and policy in HCI.</p>

<p>Website forthcoming https://t1design.org/chi-2026</p>

<p>###Cultivating Pedagogies for Post-Growth HCI</p>

<p>A cross-institutional team including the JSD Lab researcher Han Qiao and Professor Christoph Becker will co-organize Cultivating Pedagogies for Post-Growth HCI, a workshop that asks how HCI education can move beyond “bigger-and-faster” mindsets toward practices grounded in sufficiency, repair, and care.</p>

<p>Drawing on the growing field of post-growth HCI, the workshop invites educators, students, and practitioners to co-design a “living syllabus,” rethink evaluation systems, and explore how teaching itself can serve as an infrastructural practice for sustainable and just futures in computing.</p>

<p>This contribution continues the momentum from previous CHI workshops and strengthens an international community dedicated to post-growth teaching and practice.</p>

<strong>June 23 from 1030am-1230pm ET, Virtual</strong></p>

<p><strong>Session Description:</strong>
Our interactive CRAFT workshop session uses satire and creative expression to 
facilitate and strengthen collective organizing around the environmental damages caused by AI systems.</p>

<p>The JSD lab has developed a distributed satirical campaign to <a href="https://savethe.ai/">Savethe.AI</a> which uses humour 
to connect individuals’ and communities’ needs for Earth’s resources with the evidence 
of just how much of these resources are now being claimed for the data centres running generative AI. 
By connecting our thirst with a data center’s cooling system, the campaign addresses psychological 
distance: it is very hard to relate personally to the distant data centers where generative AI models do their work.</p>

<p>In our CRAFT workshop session, we will build on the satirical angle and facilitate 
a creative humorous engagement with questions of individual agency, community experiences, and 
collective resistance. We collectively explore ecological and social impacts of data centers 
and platforms that are already felt by diverse communities. These impacts vary greatly in place and 
time and are documented primarily by the tireless work of organizers, civil society, and academics, 
while being obfuscated by the companies creating the situation.</p>

<p>Our workshop invites participants to collectively develop their own humorous ideas and materials 
that express the absurdity of those harms being taken for granted and denied.</p>

<p>Through this creative process, 
we hope to achieve both a collective learning process, 
foster a sense of collective agency, possibly develop visual 
materials that the community can use, and contribute to community 
building in the face of the issues of accountability, transparency, and 
ecological and social harms that result from rampant AI.</p>

<strong>July 22 from 2:00-6:00pm at MY330 (Myhal Centre) and Online (Zoom)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Call for Participation:</strong>
Join us for an interactive workshop that delves into the ecological and social impacts of data centers, the backbone of AI infrastructure. 
As AI scales up, so does the need for data centers, which has significant environmental and social repercussions often obscured by Big Tech. This workshop aims to 
illuminate these impacts and foster collective organizing around the harms caused by data centers.</p>

<p>In the first half, we will explore the local and global implications of data centers, encouraging participants to get to know the 
impacts of particular data centers in place. We will present key findings on the environmental degradation and social injustices linked to data center operations, 
highlighting the voices of grassroots organizers who have documented these harms.</p>

<p>The second half of the workshop will embrace creativity as a tool for resistance. We will work together, using humour, satire, and art to convey the 
increasing social and environmental resource consumption taking place in data centers. Together, we will brainstorm and develop visual materials that convey these messages, transforming despair into collective agency.</p>

<p>We invite activists, researchers, and community members to contribute their perspectives and creativity. By participating, you will help build a network of 
resistance against the negative impacts of data center infrastructure, fostering a sense of community and shared purpose.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> We are looking to collaborate with a ML group (industry or academia) who wants to review and 
refine their data practices for improved documentation and reflexivity of their ML data workflow and better ML model outcomes. 
Depending on what you are interested in, this collaboration could take different shapes: jointly evaluating datasets, organizing workshops, 
action research, or other activities. We provide more information and outline some options below.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> ML research has established that bias in models often causes 
discriminatory or unethical judgements towards specific populations. These biases are widely 
attributed to the choices made about datasets used for training ML models. Datasets are often reused across tasks 
which are outside the original context they were created for and appropriate data use is also hindered by the hidden, 
tacit, and undervalued nature of data work. The adoption of principles from archival studies and digital curation into 
dataset development processes for machine learning research has been found as one way to address these concerns. <strong>Data curation</strong> is a 
mature field with origins in librarianship and archives whose scholarship and thinking on data issues go back many centuries. It has 
found new relevance today as the field of machine learning is recognizing the importance of data curation to the advancement of both 
applications and fundamental understanding of machine learning models. In practice, it has been difficult to adopt these concepts 
because they do not easily apply.</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> This project will build on our previous work in applying data curation principles in ML dataset development. We 
have previously established how data curation principles can be applied to curate datasets in ML in practice. We translated 
data curation principles and concepts for the ML dataset development context and developed an evaluation framework (composed of a 
toolkit and rubric) for dataset documentation in ML. We presented first findings and a sample set of evaluations of ML datasets in a 
FAccT2024 paper (see <a href="https://youtu.be/C5VwJBE31JY?si=lFynqavsAiL8tPpF">talk</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3630106.3658955">paper</a>). We then examined how well data curation is currently performed in ML through a larger evaluation 
of NeurIPS datasets (accepted in the NeurIPS D&amp;B track in 2024, see <a href="https://youtu.be/uLsfFjbERAI">talk</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22473">paper</a>). Our 
findings lead to suggestions on where data curation in ML can be improved.</p>

<p><strong>Research Opportunities:</strong> We are currently looking to collaborate with ML groups (industry or academia) who want to 
improve their data pipeline and practices and would be open to exploring how our framework can be adopted 
into their workflows. <strong>Our goal is to help improve data practices by applying data curation concepts; this collaborative study can have several formats and designs, we list a few versions below but are open to others based on the group’s needs and interests.</strong></p>

<p><u>Description:</u> We are looking to pilot our data curation for ML framework and integrate it into ML pipelines. This study aims 
to understand a ML group’s curation needs and collaboratively reflect on and enhance their data curation practices using 
our data curation framework. We anticipate that the collaborative process will result in a progressive learning cycle and this 
may lead to the framework evolving to better suit the needs of the ML group.</p>

<p><u>Requirements:</u></p>
<ul>
  <li>You are interested in improving your data practices. This is broadly 
construed - it includes data collection, data management, data processing and cleaning, data storage and overall data design decisions.</li>
  <li>You intend for the data to be used in a ML model. However, the approach does not have to be decided (and the curation process can also help guide this decision).</li>
  <li>Your work can be at <strong>any stage of the data pipeline</strong> - whether it be data collection or data management. For example, if the group is looking to start data collection or is ready to use the dataset within a model, we can make recommendations on how curation principles can be applied to better document and steward the data.</li>
  <li>The dataset(s) can be of <strong>any modality</strong> and regarding <strong>any domain</strong>.</li>
  <li>The dataset(s) can be <strong>new or already existing</strong>. For example, if the 
ML group often uses existing datasets, we can evaluate datasets using the framework to inform their selection of which datasets to reuse.</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Expected Activities and Outcomes:</u> 
The findings from this study would result in <strong>1) improved joint understanding of the benefits resulting from data curation, 2) tailored insights for the team’s curation processes, and 3) deepened cross-disciplinary scholarship</strong>. The project 
would thus provide insights on practical approaches in performing and adopting data curation practices that result in improved datasets and consequently models.</p>

<p>Potential activities with the expected outcomes are listed below, this is not a comprehensive list and the activities will depend on the collaborative needs of the project.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Workshop to introduce data curation concepts</li>
  <li>Collaborative examination of current curation practices and proposal for improvements for data workflows</li>
  <li>Sample evaluations of dataset documentation for new datasets created by the ML team</li>
  <li>Sample evaluations of dataset documentation for existing datasets used by the ML team (or in consideration to be used)</li>
  <li>Examination of dataset(s) to glean usage to be applied for various ML efforts</li>

<p>The Just Sustainability Design Lab at University of Toronto’s Faculty of Information 
invites you to join us for an online workshop session on “Computing and AI Through the Lens of Degrowth” 
on March 21, 2025 from 10am-12pm ET.</p>

<p>Degrowth is a coherent framework for reorganizing social and economic relations<sup>(1–4)</sup> that 
has significant implications for the role and meaning of technology development<sup>(5,6)</sup>, including in computing<sup>(7)</sup>. 
The field of computing is now beginning to grapple with degrowth and post-growth<sup>(8,9)</sup> perspectives (e.g. an upcoming 
<a href="https://pointed-waterlily-f95.notion.site/Advancing-Post-growth-HCI-15dec6ab184b809b8692ec6a3d578089">CHI workshop</a> 
and the <a href="https://computingwithinlimits.org/2025/">LIMITS workshops</a>).</p>

<p>In this informal workshop, we bring degrowth perspectives to bear on information technology and computing, 
including AI. We will briefly share recent research from the JSD lab on <em>Limits to AI Growth</em> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17980v1">(preprint)</a> and 
preliminary results on modelling the impact of AI <em>on</em> planetary Limits to Growth, then frame the conversation 
around ‘releasing technology from growth’ and open the discussion. We welcome further brief talks, lightning talks, 
or discussion prompts around the intersection of degrowth and computing.</p>

<p>The main purpose of this workshop is to foster a conversation about what it means to take a degrowth 
lens to computing and IT, including AI, and to make new connections between researchers who are 
interested in these questions.</p>

<p>Please register here for the workshop: <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/nhZ7tmNnnr">https://forms.office.com/r/nhZ7tmNnnr</a>.</p>

<p>The workshop itself is not an introduction to the framework of degrowth - we organize the 
conversation with the idea that everyone is familiar with it. But we will preface the main workshop 
session with a half-hour “Ask me Anything about Degrowth” session in which Christoph would do his best to 
respond to any questions you have. Please indicate your interest in attending the AMA, in the <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/nhZ7tmNnnr">registration form</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Eshta Bhardwaj:</strong> Eshta Bhardwaj is a PhD student at the Faculty of Information studying 
data practices in machine learning. Her research interests include examining how
techniques from data curation can improve data practices to increase accountability, transparency, and make ML model development more sustainable 
and resource-efficient. In this talk, she presents her 
recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17980v1">paper</a> which is a systemic analysis of the AI scaling landscape 
and its limiting factors (e.g., data availability) using the modelling constructs of system dynamics.</p>

<p><strong>Nara Guliyeva:</strong> Nara Guliyeva is currently a master’s student majoring in 
Human-Centered Data Science at the iSchool. She holds a Master’s degree from Columbia University and 
has worked at the United Nations Development Programme, focusing on innovation and sustainability. Her research explores how AI growth influence 
future-forward projections within the World3 Model, which examines long-term resource constraints, pioneered by the “The Limits to Growth” study. 
She investigates how AI-driven advancements—reliant on energy-intensive data centers, finite raw materials, and extensive financial investments—create feedback 
loops that may accelerate resource depletion and pollution. In this talk, she examines the role of AI growth in affecting World3 Model projections and invites 
discussion on incorporating AI-driven trends into World3 modeling.</p>

<p><strong>Christoph Becker:</strong> Christoph Becker is Full Professor at the Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto, where he leads the Just Sustainability Design lab, 
a Fellow of the SDG Scholars Academy at the University of Toronto, and a member of the School of the Environment. His transdisciplinary program of research in responsible 
computing helps enact meaningful and lasting change in computing research and practice to meet the urgent need for sustainability and social justice.</p>

<p><strong>Nadia Mariyan Smith:</strong> Nadia Mariyan Smith is a master’s student specializing in User Experience Design at the Faculty of Information. 
With a background in community work, they are interested in justice-oriented, more-than-human design approaches that emphasize collective well-being and ecological 
sustainability. In this talk, they will discuss a project they are working on with Christoph Becker and Nils Bonfils on determining the feasibility of a 
data platform cooperative for people living with diabetes.</p>

<p><strong>Nils Bonfils:</strong> Nils is a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at UofT. 
His research interest lies at the intersection of Computer Science, STS and the Environment. His current research is about 
improving current data about historical flood events in the GTA by leveraging digital newspaper archives, furthermore this project allows 
him to think about different ways of understanding and representing data about floods. Exploring alterities has always been an important aspect of research for him.</p>

data intermediaries are crucial stakeholders in facilitating data access and use. 
Community advocates live in these sites of social injustices and opportunities for change. 
Highly experienced in working with data to enact change, they offer distinctive insights on data practices and tools. 
This paper examines the unique perspectives that community advocates offer on data intermediaries. Based on interviews with 17 
advocates working with 23 grassroots and nonprofit organizations, we propose the quality of “near” and “far” to be seriously considered in 
data intermediaries’ works and articulate advocates’ vision of connecting “near data” and “far data.” To pursue this vision, 
we identified three pathways for data intermediaries: align data exploration with ways of storytelling, communicate context and 
uncertainties, and decenter artifacts for relationship building. These pathways help data intermediaries to put data feminism 
into practice, surface design opportunities and tensions, and raise key questions for supporting the pursuit of the Right to the City.</p>
