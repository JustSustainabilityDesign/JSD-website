Because all outcomes from policies relevant to climate change occur at a distance, decision-makers experience so-called ‘psychological distance’ to environmental decisions in terms of space, time, 
social identity, and hypotheticality. Since policy decisions to achieve a safe planetary space are urgently needed for immediate transition, we need a design practice that takes into account how 
psychological distance affects cognition and decision-making. Our paper explores the role of alternative design approaches in developing visualizations used for climate policymaking. Our paper 
lays out how future research on the impacts of alternative design approaches on psychological distance can make data used for policy decisions more tangible and visceral. In the paper, we synthesize 
literature from environmental psychology and social and cognitive psychology to explore how the design of decision tools can leverage approaches like speculative design and data visceralization to invoke 
affective responses to environmental decisions to help traverse psychological distance. It was accepted at the Tenth 
Workshop on Computing within Limits (LIMITS 2024). The paper can be found <a href="https://computingwithinlimits.org/2024/papers/limits2024-bhardwaj-psychological-distance.pdf">here</a> and the recorded talk

that make model development possible and shape its outcomes. Many argue that the adoption of theory 
and practices from archives and data curation fields can support greater fairness, accountability, 
transparency, and more ethical machine learning.</p>

<p>In response, we are examining data practices in machine learning dataset development through the 
lens of data curation. We evaluate data practices in machine learning <strong>as data curation practices</strong>.</p>

<p>For our first paper on this topic, “Machine Learning Data Practices through a Data Curation Lens: 
An Evaluation Framework”, we evaluated data practices in machine learning as data curation practices. 
We developed an evaluation rubric and applied it to a sample of NeurIPS papers to see 
what we would find. It was accepted at the ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and 
Transparency (ACM FAccT 2024).</p>

<p>The 12 minute talk is available on <a href="https://youtu.be/C5VwJBE31JY?si=lFynqavsAiL8tPpF">YouTube</a>. 
The paper can be read <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3630106.3658955">here</a>.</p>

<p>To evaluate data practices in machine learning as data curation practices, 
we developed a framework for evaluating machine learning datasets using data curation 
concepts and principles through a rubric. Through a mixed-methods analysis of evaluation results 
for 25 ML datasets, we study the feasibility of data curation principles to be adopted for machine 
learning data work in practice and explore how data curation is currently performed. We find that 
researchers in machine learning, which often emphasizes model development, struggle to apply 
standard data curation principles. Our findings illustrate difficulties at the intersection of 
these fields, such as evaluating dimensions that have shared terms in both fields but non-shared 
meanings, a high degree of interpretative flexibility in adapting concepts without 
prescriptive restrictions, obstacles in limiting the depth of data curation expertise needed to 
apply the rubric, and challenges in scoping the extent of documentation dataset creators are 
responsible for. We propose ways to address these challenges and develop an overall framework 
for evaluation that outlines how data curation concepts and methods can inform machine learning 
data practices.</p>]]></content><author><name>eshta-bhardwaj</name></author><category term="paper" /><category term="talk" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our paper, Machine Learning Data Practices through a Data Curation Lens: An Evaluation Framework, has been accepted at the ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT 2024).
