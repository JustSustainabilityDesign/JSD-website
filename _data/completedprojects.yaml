  description: In our recent article, we set a foundation for future studies of intertemporal choices by showing that they are ubiquitous in systems design practice and poorly understood and showing how we can study them in realistic ways.

  description: Temporal discounting indicates that outcomes at a distance may seem less important to us than closer ones. How do we think about these intertemporal choices in practice? What effects does this have?  We performed the first study of decision making in software projects that asked how software professionals discount future outcomes. Our findings have significant practical implications.
