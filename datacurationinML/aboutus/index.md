## Get in Touch to Collaborate on the Data Curation in Machine Learning Project!

In the next stages, we want to explore how researchers and practitioners can use the evaluation tool to better understand their curation needs and challenges. 
So we would like to hear from ML researchers interested in this approach. 
The rubric can be used to evaluate your own datasets, or your curation processes, or evaluate an existing dataset when making decisions about reuse. 
Please [reach out](mailto:eshta.bhardwaj@mail.utoronto.ca) if youâ€™re interested. More details about the collaboration opportunity can be found [here](https://justsustainabilitydesign.org/2025/03/27/dcml_project_recruitment.html).
