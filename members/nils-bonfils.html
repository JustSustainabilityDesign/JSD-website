<p>Nils is a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at UofT. 
After completing his BSc and MSc degrees in CS from EPFL, he worked in the 
banking and telecom industries as a Software Engineer for a few years. This allowed 
him to recognize the proportions and unsustainability of modern technological trends. 
He decided to pursue a PhD to explore and understand alternative ontologies in 
which information technology practices can be made more sustainable. His research 
interests span across Computer Science, Information, STS and the Environment. 
Other subtopics of interest are permacomputing, digital degrowth, collapse 
informatics and broken world thinking.</p>
