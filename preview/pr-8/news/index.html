  <p data-search="Are you interested in your data curation practices Summary  We are looking to collaborate with a ML group  industry or academia  who wants to review and refine their data practices for improved documentation and reflexivity of their ML data workflow and better ML model outcomes  Depending on what you are interested in  this collaboration could take different shapes  jointly evaluating datasets  organizing workshops  action research  or other activities  We provide more information and outline some options below Context  ML research has established that bias in models often causes discriminatory or unethical judgements towards specific populations  These biases are widely attributed to the choices made about datasets used for training ML models  Datasets are often reused across tasks which are outside the original context they were created for and appropriate data use is also hindered by the hidden  tacit  and undervalued nature of data work  The adoption of principles from archival studies and digital curation into dataset development processes for machine learning research has been found as one way to address these concerns  Data curation is a mature field with origins in librarianship and archives whose scholarship and thinking on data issues go back many centuries  It has found new relevance today as the field of machine learning is recognizing the importance of data curation to the advancement of both applications and fundamental understanding of machine learning models  In practice  it has been difficult to adopt these concepts because they do not easily apply Background  This project will build on our previous work in applying data curation principles in ML dataset development  We have previously established how data curation principles can be applied to curate datasets in ML in practice  We translated data curation principles and concepts for the ML dataset development context and developed an evaluation framework  composed of a toolkit and rubric  for dataset documentation in ML  We presented first findings and a sample set of evaluations of ML datasets in a FAccT2024 paper  see talk and paper   We then examined how well data curation is currently performed in ML through a larger evaluation of NeurIPS datasets  accepted in the NeurIPS D amp B track in 2024  see talk and paper   Our findings lead to suggestions on where data curation in ML can be improved Research Opportunities  We are currently looking to collaborate with ML groups  industry or academia  who want to improve their data pipeline and practices and would be open to exploring how our framework can be adopted into their workflows  Our goal is to help improve data practices by applying data curation concepts  this collaborative study can have several formats and designs  we list a few versions below but are open to others based on the group s needs and interests Description  We are looking to pilot our data curation for ML framework and integrate it into ML pipelines  This study aims to understand a ML group s curation needs and collaboratively reflect on and enhance their data curation practices using our data curation framework  We anticipate that the collaborative process will result in a progressive learning cycle and this may lead to the framework evolving to better suit the needs of the ML group Requirements   You are interested in improving your data practices  This is broadly construed   it includes data collection  data management  data processing and cleaning  data storage and overall data design decisions   You intend for the data to be used in a ML model  However  the approach does not have to be decided  and the curation process can also help guide this decision    Your work can be at any stage of the data pipeline   whether it be data collection or data management  For example  if the group is looking to start data collection or is ready to use the dataset within a model  we can make recommendations on how curation principles can be applied to better document and steward the data   The dataset s  can be of any modality and regarding any domain   The dataset s  can be new or already existing  For example  if the ML group often uses existing datasets  we can evaluate datasets using the framework to inform their selection of which datasets to reuse Expected Activities and Outcomes  The findings from this study would result in 1  improved joint understanding of the benefits resulting from data curation  2  tailored insights for the team s curation processes  and 3  deepened cross disciplinary scholarship  The project would thus provide insights on practical approaches in performing and adopting data curation practices that result in improved datasets and consequently models Potential activities with the expected outcomes are listed below  this is not a comprehensive list and the activities will depend on the collaborative needs of the project   Workshop to introduce data curation concepts  Collaborative examination of current curation practices and proposal for improvements for data workflows  Sample evaluations of dataset documentation for new datasets created by the ML team  Sample evaluations of dataset documentation for existing datasets used by the ML team  or in consideration to be used   Examination of dataset s  to glean usage to be applied for various ML effortsIf you are interested  please contact Prof  Christoph Becker at christoph becker utoronto ca ">

  <p data-search="Are you interested in your data curation practices Summary  We are looking to collaborate with a ML group  industry or academia  who wants to review and refine their data practices for improved documentation and reflexivity of their ML data workflow and better ML model outcomes  Depending on what you are interested in  this collaboration could take different shapes  jointly evaluating datasets  organizing workshops  action research  or other activities  We provide more information and outline some options below Context  ML research has established that bias in models often causes discriminatory or unethical judgements towards specific populations  These biases are widely attributed to the choices made about datasets used for training ML models  Datasets are often reused across tasks which are outside the original context they were created for and appropriate data use is also hindered by the hidden  tacit  and undervalued nature of data work  The adoption of principles from archival studies and digital curation into dataset development processes for machine learning research has been found as one way to address these concerns  Data curation is a mature field with origins in librarianship and archives whose scholarship and thinking on data issues go back many centuries  It has found new relevance today as the field of machine learning is recognizing the importance of data curation to the advancement of both applications and fundamental understanding of machine learning models  In practice  it has been difficult to adopt these concepts because they do not easily apply Background  This project will build on our previous work in applying data curation principles in ML dataset development  We have previously established how data curation principles can be applied to curate datasets in ML in practice  We translated data curation principles and concepts for the ML dataset development context and developed an evaluation framework  composed of a toolkit and rubric  for dataset documentation in ML  We presented first findings and a sample set of evaluations of ML datasets in a FAccT2024 paper  see talk and paper   We then examined how well data curation is currently performed in ML through a larger evaluation of NeurIPS datasets  accepted in the NeurIPS D amp B track in 2024  see talk and paper   Our findings lead to suggestions on where data curation in ML can be improved Research Opportunities  We are currently looking to collaborate with ML groups  industry or academia  who want to improve their data pipeline and practices and would be open to exploring how our framework can be adopted into their workflows  Our goal is to help improve data practices by applying data curation concepts  this collaborative study can have several formats and designs  we list a few versions below but are open to others based on the group s needs and interests Description  We are looking to pilot our data curation for ML framework and integrate it into ML pipelines  This study aims to understand a ML group s curation needs and collaboratively reflect on and enhance their data curation practices using our data curation framework  We anticipate that the collaborative process will result in a progressive learning cycle and this may lead to the framework evolving to better suit the needs of the ML group Requirements   You are interested in improving your data practices  This is broadly construed   it includes data collection  data management  data processing and cleaning  data storage and overall data design decisions   You intend for the data to be used in a ML model  However  the approach does not have to be decided  and the curation process can also help guide this decision    Your work can be at any stage of the data pipeline   whether it be data collection or data management  For example  if the group is looking to start data collection or is ready to use the dataset within a model  we can make recommendations on how curation principles can be applied to better document and steward the data   The dataset s  can be of any modality and regarding any domain   The dataset s  can be new or already existing  For example  if the ML group often uses existing datasets  we can evaluate datasets using the framework to inform their selection of which datasets to reuse Expected Activities and Outcomes  The findings from this study would result in 1  improved joint understanding of the benefits resulting from data curation  2  tailored insights for the team s curation processes  and 3  deepened cross disciplinary scholarship  The project would thus provide insights on practical approaches in performing and adopting data curation practices that result in improved datasets and consequently models Potential activities with the expected outcomes are listed below  this is not a comprehensive list and the activities will depend on the collaborative needs of the project   Workshop to introduce data curation concepts  Collaborative examination of current curation practices and proposal for improvements for data workflows  Sample evaluations of dataset documentation for new datasets created by the ML team  Sample evaluations of dataset documentation for existing datasets used by the ML team  or in consideration to be used   Examination of dataset s  to glean usage to be applied for various ML effortsIf you are interested  please contact Prof  Christoph Becker at christoph becker utoronto ca ">

  <p data-search="Studies of dataset development in machine learning call for greater attention to the data practices that make model development possible and shape its outcomes  Many argue that the adoption of theory and practices from archives and data curation fields can support greater fairness  accountability  transparency  and more ethical machine learning In response  we are examining data practices in machine learning dataset development through the lens of data curation  We evaluate data practices in machine learning as data curation practices For our first paper on this topic   Machine Learning Data Practices through a Data Curation Lens  An Evaluation Framework   we evaluated data practices in machine learning as data curation practices  We developed an evaluation rubric and applied it to a sample of NeurIPS papers to see what we would find  It was accepted at the ACM Conference on Fairness  Accountability  and Transparency  ACM FAccT 2024  The 12 minute talk is available on YouTube  The paper can be read here To evaluate data practices in machine learning as data curation practices  we developed a framework for evaluating machine learning datasets using data curation concepts and principles through a rubric  Through a mixed methods analysis of evaluation results for 25 ML datasets  we study the feasibility of data curation principles to be adopted for machine learning data work in practice and explore how data curation is currently performed  We find that researchers in machine learning  which often emphasizes model development  struggle to apply standard data curation principles  Our findings illustrate difficulties at the intersection of these fields  such as evaluating dimensions that have shared terms in both fields but non shared meanings  a high degree of interpretative flexibility in adapting concepts without prescriptive restrictions  obstacles in limiting the depth of data curation expertise needed to apply the rubric  and challenges in scoping the extent of documentation dataset creators are responsible for  We propose ways to address these challenges and develop an overall framework for evaluation that outlines how data curation concepts and methods can inform machine learning data practices ">
    Our paper, Machine Learning Data Practices through a Data Curation Lens: An Evaluation Framework, has been accepted at the ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT 2024). See full post for the links to the paper and recorded talk.
